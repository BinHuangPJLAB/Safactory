## ✨ Why Safactory?

Safactory provides a **unified pipeline** so you can go from model evaluation to RL training without changing your codebase:

| Goal | What Safactory does |
|------|---------------------|
| **Evaluate agents** | Run any LLM against realistic simulated environments and collect reward metrics |
| **Build training data** | Every interaction is automatically logged to SQLite — ready to be used as SFT / RL data |
| **RL training** | Feed rollout data directly into Slime-based GRPO training via the built-in Buffer Server |

Key strengths:

- 🌍 **Multi-domain environments** — Android, OS, Minecraft, RoboTrustBench, Embodied ALFRED and more
- ⚡ **High concurrency** — Environment pool management with async workers for fast parallel rollouts
- 🔌 **LLM-agnostic** — Works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM, SGLang, OpenAI API)
- 🏗️ **Two deployment modes** — `local` (single machine) or `remote` (Ray-based cluster)
- 🧩 **Extensible** — Add a new environment in < 50 lines by implementing a simple `BaseEnv` interface

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI45Lab/Safactory.git
cd Safactory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1 — Evaluate a Model

```bash
python launcher.py \
  --env-config env/osgym/os_config.yaml \   # Select the evaluation environment (OS / Android / Minecraft, etc.)
  --llm-base-url http://YOUR_LLM_HOST/v1 \  # Model service address
  --llm-api-key YOUR_API_KEY \              # API Key
  --llm-model YOUR_MODEL \                  # Model name
  --pool-size 1                             # Number of concurrent environment instances
```

This command will automatically complete environment loading, task scheduling, and evaluation execution.

**Configuration**

* **CLI parameters**: Control model access and concurrent execution（e.g., `--llm-*`, `--pool-size`）

* **YAML configuration**: Defines specific environments and tasks (e.g., dataset, environment parameters)

### 2 — Collect Training Data

Every run automatically records step-level interactions (messages, response, reward, environment state) to `test_envs.db`. Records are available immediately after the run completes.

See [docs/data-manager.md](./docs/data-manager.md) for the database schema and example queries.

### 3 — RL Training (Optional)

With a rollout runner active, start the Slime training loop in a second terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Slime training process (requires Slime installation)
cd rl && ./run_slime_generator_vl.sh

# Terminal 2 — Buffer Server (launches the Safactory runner and collects rollouts)
cd rl && ./run_buffer_server.sh
```

> Terminals 1 and 2 can run on different machines as long as they can communicate.

Full setup guide: [docs/rl-training.md](./docs/rl-training.md)

### 4 — Experience Extraction & Injection（Optional）

Safactory supports optional experience extraction and injection. You can distill reusable lessons from historical trajectories into a local experience library, then inject relevant experience into the agent prompt at the start of a new episode.

For a detailed usage guide, see [docs/experience-extraction-injection.md](docs/experience-extraction-injection.md).
